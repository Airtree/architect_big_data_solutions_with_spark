### Introduction 

This repository contains lectures and codes for the course that aims to provide 
a gentle introduction on how to build distributed big data pipelines with the help of Apache Spark. Furthermore, we try to address different capabilities of Apache Spark for building ETL/ Batch, Streaming, and Machine Learning data pipelines.
